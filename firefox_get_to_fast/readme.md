Notice that not only Firefox get this problem ,but alse Chrome and IE11 do .
I tried testing it on my own computer and found it didn't do the same when I tried testing on the computer of my company .
On my own computer , all of the browers turn to be get 0 while without image.onload .
So be sure when you want to get the information of a image , you should use the event "image.onload".
